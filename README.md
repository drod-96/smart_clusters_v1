# Project description

This project contains codes to create graphic representation of simulated District Heating Networks, to generate random-walk based clusters, and machine learning pipeline framework to learn and replace cmlusters. 

Graphic representation and manipulation are realized using Networkx [https://networkx.org/], a python package built for creation, manipulation and study of complex networks structures.

The machine learning models are created using Keras [https://keras.io/], an open-access and straightforward to-use deep learning library built on top of tensorflow. Not *defined hyperpameters* use default values provided by Keras. By default, tensorflow performs training on gpu if available.
